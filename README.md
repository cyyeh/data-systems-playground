# Data Systems Playground

## Motivation

This repo is an experimentation playground to help me explore various tools related to data systems. The objective that I created this repo is that I can thus better understand various data tools by playing around with them, reading their documentations, inspecting their source code to further know their strengths, limitations, best use cases, design principles, etc.
