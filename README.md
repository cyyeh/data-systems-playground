# Data Systems Playground

> Here is an experimentation playground to help me explore various tools related to data systems.

## Motivation

The objective that I created this repo is that I can thus better understand various data tools by playing around with them, reading their documentations and inspecting their source code, etc. to further know their strengths, limitations, best use cases, design principles, etc.
